# Bass Page Layout
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS</strong>

The fun challenge for this project was trying to figure out how to generate images out of “nowhere” using ::before.

I imagine trying to go this far to separate content and design isn’t that practical for real sites, but it’s very interesting for learning.

I just had a scary/cool moment when the narrow-width version of the page suddenly seemed all messed up, but then I realized I was actually looking at <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/bass/index.html">the example page‘s tab</a> by mistake =D
